#Extrasize

##Project Description
This application exists to make people's scheduling activties easier and more efficient. We are all busy whether that is at school, or at work, but one thing is forsure, we all use some form of scheduling. although some people use Google Calendar, and some use other apps, we are first launching this application using the Google Calendar API. 

Our purpose is to allow our users to be able to schedule their workouts through our app and have it write those work outs to their strava app aswell as to their calendar. This way, they can see all their workouts on the same platform as the rest of their tasks and activities.
