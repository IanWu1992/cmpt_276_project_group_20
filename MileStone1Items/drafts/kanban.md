Kanban Agile Methedology

Why Kanban?
    One of the problems we face in this project is the lack of expierence we have in a project of this scale. It would be difficult to use a waterfall method for example as we do not know all the steps that would be required before we get started.

    With kanban we can dynamically add tasks to the list of todo things. Allowing us to be for flexible solve problems we do not know are coming. With such a small team the biggest advantage we have is the ease of communication. Kanban requires excellent communication to be pulled off.

    A concern we have with using Kanban is the complexity, with the ability to always add addition tasks to the to-do list we face the problem of a never ending list. 


    For our Kanban billboard we will have 4 lists
    1. to-do  
        list of tasks yet that need to be actioned
    2. doing 
        active that that are currently being worked on
    3. review
        tasks that are completed but should be reviewed by third party
    4. completed
        tasks that have passed the review process
