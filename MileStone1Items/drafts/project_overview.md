Our project is centered on developing an innovative running workout application that integrates seamlessly with APIs like Google Calendar and Strava to enhance the user experience in planning and tracking fitness activities. Utilizing a dynamic Kanban methodology to manage our workflow, we are able to address the challenges posed by our team's relative inexperience with large-scale projects by allowing for flexible task management and prioritization. The application is being built with a robust technology stack, leveraging the interactive capabilities of React for the frontend, coupled with the foundational web technologies HTML and CSS for structure and style. This combination provides users with a responsive and intuitive interface to schedule workouts, track their progress over time, and analyze their performance with visually engaging maps and statistics. As we progress, our focus on effective communication within the team and a rigorous review process ensures that we maintain high standards of quality and functionality in each phase of the project, from initial planning through to deployment and closure. This way, we can make sure our app is easy to use and works well from the time we start building it until we're ready to share it with everyone.
