1.Cindy loves planning. She schedules her whole day in google calender and wants to plan runs into her day. She does not want to have to input them into google calendar and strava.

2.Jeff is a lazy runner. When he does run it is a spur of the moment decision. He wants to keep track of his past runs in his google calendar, while also showing off to his friends on strava the runs he goes on. He does not want to have to use two applications to do this.
